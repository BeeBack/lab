<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>FWPolice is a community of professional designers and developers dedicated in teaching others about coding and designing tools.</p>
<p>We are comprised of several named designers from each of the community we cater to and are adding new volunteers often. In the past we only catered to Adobe Fireworks community, but now we are expanding our base to Sketch, Affinity Designer and more. Furthermore, we are also starting to bring our premium (and coded) themes and templates to you here free of charge.</p>
<h4>Our Team</h4>
<p>We’re nerds. That’s right, we’re a bunch of pet loving, coffee drinking, tech savvy nerds. We just happened to be decent at coding and designing. And growing up, we were taught ‘sharing is caring, and it can be fun’. Oh, we’re also a bit crazy...</p>
<h4>Clients &amp; Users</h4>
<p>Our work is used by many users and companies throughout the world. If we listed them all, it would take the page forever to load. So, we’ll just leave the list our little secret for now. If you do want your logo displayed here, shoot us an email with a link to your company logo. For now, here's one of our favorite testimonial</p>
<blockquote>
    “Just wanted to say – I absolutely LOVE what you guys are doing for Fireworks! Real pioneers. :)”
